# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Shaun Bray

Repo for the course project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course from John Hopkins University

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare 
tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Project Summary

The following is a summary of the instructions for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
